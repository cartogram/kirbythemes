Text: We designers are a competitive bunch. Award-winning projects influence trends and show the strongest work being created in studios across the country and around the world. I’m proud to announce that Head-to-Head won a Coupe Award for Complete Book Design AND it was included on Coupe’s prestigious list of the Top 25 titles for 2012! Head-to-Head also won a Bronze ADCC Award for Complete Book Design.
