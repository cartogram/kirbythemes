Text: Working with clients to revisit and tweak marketing materials is a solid strategy to keep an audience engaged and invested. When commissioned to re-design the Program Guide for the Neuberger Holocaust Education Centre’s signature event, Holocaust Education Week (HEW), the goal was to increase visibility and expand the profile of the weeklong event while maintaining a respect for the topic. HEW organizers wanted to move away from the sensibility of an internally designed suite of materials toward something more visually ambitious. A gradual evolution over two years provided a steady transition.

In the latest iteration of the guide, refined typography and simplified formatting highlights the programming, along with a greater focus on colour and visuals. Cover imagery created by participating artists adds depth to both the larger event directory and a new, condensed, “mini” guide, which complement each other and expand the reach of the HEW’s marketing materials while capitalizing on the available budget. The results have been positive, contributing to the HEW’s ambitious audience development goals. Long-term design relationships create results with a sense of continuity that strengthen the connections among a client’s various projects. A design revamp as seamless as the HEW’s program guide is possible thanks to the client’s commitment to collaborate on a carefully considered change in their materials.
