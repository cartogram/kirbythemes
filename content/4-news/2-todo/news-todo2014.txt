Text: If you are free on the evening of the 20th of January come out to hear me talk about my studio practice as part of the exciting 2014 Toronto Design Offsite Festival.

The Toronto Design Offsite Festival (TO DO) is a not-for-profit, independent design festival happening annually at the end of January. TO DO’s aim is to provide exposure for local and national designers; to foster public understanding and knowledge of the practice of design; and to create an ongoing presence that promotes Canada’s creativity, drawing on great thinkers, practitioners, and educators to a deliver an innovative celebration of art and design. The fourth annual Toronto Design Offsite Festival will show the best in Canadian design at exhibitions and events across the city, from unexpected prototypes to immersive installations, January 20–26, 2014.
