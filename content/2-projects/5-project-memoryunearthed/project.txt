Text: I met the man who would become my husband, Tibor Kalman, in college. He was a journalism major, and I was an English major, but we both dropped out. Tibor got a job at a bookstore at NYU. One day, the window dresser was sick, and Tibor said, “Oh, I can do that.” He went on to become an incredible graphic designer, journalist, and editor. He and I were always working together, and, at the same time, I was starting to draw and wanted to do editorial illustration. We both traveled in this path together, getting any work we could. We eventually got more work that we were in control of, that we were the authors of. It then became about the content and doing something irreverent and unusual, but communicative.
