Text: 
This mid-career survey of interdisciplinary artworks by Toronto-based artist Laurel Woodcock forms a snapshot of her use, and purposeful misuse, of language and ideas. The artist’s work incorporates a broad range of media, from video to installation to fabrication to explore the ability of common language to become layered with multiple and unexpected meanings.

Vivid orange endpapers prepare the reader for what’s to come inside; carefully conceived and executed conceptual art accented with lush colour. That same orange is used throughout the tightly sequenced layout, in page-breaks and title captions, referencing the highlighter colour that the artist often uses in her work.

To add a personal touch to balance the publication’s sleek design, a detail was conceived for the title page that borrows from Woodcock’s art practice; a sort-of artist multiple made using an indestructible Post-it Note material letterpressed with handwritten text to give an authentic pen-imprinted feel.
