Text: This project for Toronto-based artist Derek Sullivan acts as both an exhibition catalogue and a conceptual extension of the artistâ€™s installation project. French-fold binding maintains a lengthwise format resulting in a continuous flow of images and texts that wrap around the outer edge of each page. The effect recalls the extended, horizontal displays of advertising common to many subway stations.
Fully opened, the book has a commanding presence that is intentionally image-heavy, suggesting an artist multiple. The French-fold design is sculpturally rich and references the in situ exhibition of the work, with its continuous flow preserved. The design dictated that printing be applied to only one side, then folded upon itself, economizing production expenses through the use of thinner, less costly stock.
The packaging offers its own surprises. The book jacket expands to reveal a small poster; its own artist multiple within the project.
