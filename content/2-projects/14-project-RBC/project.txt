Text: The annual RBC Painting Competition is among Canada’s top arts prizes. Established in 1999 through a partnership with the prestigious Canadian Art Foundation, this program promotes and nurtures promising emerging artists.

15,000 catalogues are distributed nationally, solidifying RBC’s reputation as an arts leader invested in future generations of art makers. A coast-to-coast dispersal requires the publication to be easily identifiable as both a branded corporate document as well as a substantial yet elegant contemporary art publication.

Energetic brushstrokes on the catalogue cover, applied in gradients of the client’s signature blue, reference the physical act of painting while suggesting the emerging talents presented in the book. A strict grid and minimal type results in reduced noise on the cover and on each page, helping the works of art to stand out.
