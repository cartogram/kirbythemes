Text: Creating this publication was a rewarding exercise in managing a tight budget and an equally tight turnaround time. Wedge Curatorial Projects Founder, Kenneth Montague, had spent years assembling an art collection thematically linked to the African Canadian experience. Position as Desired was conceived as a record of the collection as well as a document that explores what it means to be African Canadian at this point in history.

Accompanying an exhibition through the Royal Ontario Museum’s Department of World Cultures, a non-traditional approach to the publication’s layout bridges the concept of what a book of photography can be; not a catalogue but not a photo album, either. Starting with photos of Montague’s family, the book progresses through a series of essays juxtaposed with works by multiple artists, creating a sense of moving back and forth through history. To reinforce that idea, the selected type treatment references vintage photo albums while maintaining a current flourish.
