This softcover publication presents the fantastic dreamscapes that Rocan is known for. It’s a full-colour production in every way, right down to the texts. The design of this 9” x 9” book takes its cue from the paintings documented inside. Vivid, saturated hues dominate these paintings, showing work that is bold yet feminine, intensely personal, self-reflective and sometimes unsettling. As an object, Souvenir involontaire shocks the eye with its full-bleed pages and hot pink edges that reference old-fashioned gold book edging.
