Text: An ambitious commission from The Power Plant Contemporary Art Gallery, Albatross Omnibus is a collection of 52 limited edition books, a series of drawings, and a gallery installation. This publication, which documents the exhibition, shares Sullivan’s fluid approach to materials.

The deconstructed publication is packaged as two components; a 26-foot-long accordion book and a saddle-stitched collection of essays, housed together in a letterpress-printed slipcase. The accordion book reproduces, in 1:1 scale, the 52 book covers shown in the gallery installation, referencing Sullivan’s play on sequence and spacing. On the reverse of the accordion, installation images are cropped and connected at various scales and combinations. Fully opened, the accordion component becomes a work of art unto itself that can be viewed page-by-page like a standard book or displayed in a serpentine sculptural shape.
