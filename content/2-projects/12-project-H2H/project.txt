Text: Mid-career artists Lexier and Mark contemplate the passage of time in their independent art practices. To showcase their ongoing explorations of routine and ritual, Head-to-Head playfully presents the artists’ works in 18 pairings that offer insight into their processes, creative sensibilities, and competitive natures.

The pair enjoys a friendly rivalry, as demonstrated in Duet, a collaborative work that takes the form of an email exchange between Lexier and Mark that has them going head-to-head, trading lyrics from the Irving Berlin song, “Anything You Can Do (I Can Do Better),” from the musical Annie Get Your Gun.

Conceptually, the catalogue continues to reflect the artists’ relationship and practices, mimicking Duet’s repetition within the layout to establish a rhythmic transition between Lexier and Mark’s works of art. A modest budget influenced the decision to print in black and white complemented by one highlight colour, which focuses the reader’s attention as the book progresses from piece to piece and artist to artist.
