Text: The exhibition catalogue supporting Out of Place features the work of three Canadian francophone artists interested in exploring ideas of place. They each create new, fictional environments through the manipulation of authentic or “real” source material.
To capture the themes of the exhibition, the layout mimics the landscape orientation of many of the works of art; printing the pages with a subtle shadowy tint references the intimate feeling of the minimally lit gallery setting. No true blacks were used, only shades of grey, giving the book a muted serenity. Preparatory sketches of artwork concepts were incorporated to add depth to the content. Bilingual texts run side-by-side using a delicate, feminine typeface.
