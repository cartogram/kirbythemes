Text:  This non-traditional exhibition catalogue pays homage to artist Peter Smith by combining his affinity for texture, unusual materials and contrast of “high vs. low” cultural references. Smith’s DIY approach to his practice is reflected in the book’s simple, ‘zine-inspired binding with texts and photos printed black and white on newsprint. Corresponding to the handmade feel of the textual aspects of the publication, reproductions of Smith’s long, horizontal works of art are printed in vibrant high-gloss colour and then folded, rather than running them inside the book’s gutter, with image details printed on the reverse of each foldout.

During the development phase of this exhibition for Doris McCarthy Gallery, the curator received several thoughtful yet entertaining emails from the artist; several of them are included, inserted randomly and by hand in each copy, to lend a more intimate feeling to the book.

2010 OAAG Book Design Award

Deceptively simple cover hides a treasure of mixed paper stocks and inks, 
blow-ins and gatefolds. Lush reproductions on coated tock with sizeable text 
printed economically on uncoated newsprint create unexpectedly successful 
juxtapositions. The inserted e-mails add a level of intimacy with the 
artist's process. —OAAG Jurors Comments
