Text: Prepared to coincide with a retrospective at the Art Gallery of Ontario, this catalogue presents the work of seminal Romanian-Canadian artist, writer, filmmaker and philosopher Sorel Etrog. A prominent and influential personality during his heyday (he represented Canada at the 1966 Venice Biennale), the exhibition and publication focus renewed attention on Etrog’s output, complemented by reprinted and new critical essays as well as images sourced from five decades of documentation.

The book’s design takes its cue from Etrog’s primary medium—sculpture—with special attention paid to restoring many of the historical photographs used to present a narrative of the artist’s life. The powerful physical presence of Etrog’s art influenced the use of large, full-bleed images rendered in vibrant UV inks. Printed on uncoated stock, and with metallic bronze endpapers to reference the sculptor’s body of work, the publication provides a substantially tactile experience to the reader.
