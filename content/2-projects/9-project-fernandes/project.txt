Text: A primary challenge with the design of this book, a publication in support of Fernandes’ Art Gallery of Hamilton exhibition, until we fearless, involved solving the particular issue around representing video-based and sculptural art within a 2-D format. By treating the installation photography as documentary, a successful solution was achieved which provides a visually comfortable progression between several bodies of work.
A type treatment was created for the book cover and title pages based on the recurring use of Morse code in Fernandes’ work. Additionally, Concrete poetry and Dadaism inspired other typography choices to illustrate the artist’s concepts of language. Family snapshots throughout the layout reference the artist’s overall practice while also informing the reader of existing stereotypes that falsely sustain the idea of a homogeneous African culture.

2010 OAAG Award for Book Design

We were all immediately drawn to this book for its use of colour, uncoated stock, cropping and placement of imagery, mix of unique fonts, and, of course, the sexy centre (gate) fold. The design serves the artist's intent to the point where we almost considered this to be an Artist Book. Clearly the designer and the artist are on the same wavelength
